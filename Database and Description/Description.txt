1. I created a WordPress plugin from scratch
2. Events can be added by admins
3. Every Event has a title, body (caption in my code), category(event type in my code), event date, and an image than can be resized
4. Taxonomy: Events can be filtered by category by the user, and can be filtered by category and posting date by the admin
5. Events can be scheduled to be posted later
6. If the admin does not choose an event type it is automatically categorized as "uncategorized" type
7. Short Code: please use [mycalendar_event_list] to show posts in a page
