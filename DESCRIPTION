I created a WordPress plugin from scratch
Events can be added by admins
Every Event has a title, body (caption in my code), category(event type in my code), event date, and an image than can be resized
Taxonomy: Events can be filtered by category by the user, and can be filtered by category and posting date by the admin
Events can be scheduled to be posted later
If the admin does not choose an event type it is automatically categorized as "uncategorized" type
Short Code: please use [mycalendar_event_list] to show posts in a page
